Hangman Game

# Description:

This Hangman game is a classic word guessing game implemented using JavaScript and React. Players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman is drawn. The game ends either when the player guesses the word correctly or when the hangman is fully drawn.
